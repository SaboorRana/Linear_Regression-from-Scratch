# Linear_Regression-from-Scratch
I implemented a custom Linear_Regression model for predicting continuous outcomes. It's easy to customize and fine-tune, ideal for learning and experimenting with different parameters. This model is great for understanding linear relationships and serves as a robust educational tool.  #MachineLearning #DataAnalysis
